        <p><center><h1>My name is Fouzia Morium. I'm a dreamer, I'm a believer and I'm a doer. I can speak well both Bangla and English.</h1>
        <h3>Another quality of me that I feel very proud of is I'm a quick learner and self-motivated person. I lean making & desinging dresses and also home decoration things.
        It's  tough job for most people.</br> </br> </br>
        I was born in Eskaton Garden, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I spend my childhood here. My father is a businessman and my mother does what she loves 
        the most, she take care of us. I have two sisters & one brother, they are also student.</br> </br> </br>
        I am frank & pretty friendly. I have my only weakness which is, I can't say No to people. I find it difficult to refuse 
        people specially when it's about helping them.</h3>
